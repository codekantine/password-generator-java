# Password Generator (legacy)

NOTE: This project contains the legacy version from 2018. You might still want
to use it in case you need a Java implementation of this tool. Everyone else
should utilize the current JS version:

# How to use the binary

## Windows, Mac

- Make sure you have the latest Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed:

    https://www.java.com/

- Just Drag and Drop the 'password-generator.jar' file into a folder on your
    system and run it from there.

## Linux

- Using OpenJDK instead of the proprietary JRE is highly recommended. Most
    Debian based systems (e. g. Ubuntu, Linux Mint,...) should already have it
    installed, but you'll need the additional 'openjfx' package:

    sudo apt install openjfx
